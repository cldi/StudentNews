VIAF AUTHORITY RECORDS
viafURI_v2.py will lookup VIAF authorities for named entities (people, organizations, places...).
The result is a tab-delimited file with three or more columns.
Col 1: VIAF ID
Col 2: full URL
Col 3+: prefered terms for that ID

Currently, there is limited UI built in to the application and requires the easygui package.
To install easygui, type the following line in your command line:
easy_install easygui

Also, if it looks like the application has stalled after asking for a save location, you might have a
file explorer box hidden behind an application window.
