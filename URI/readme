URI folder stores the code and workflow information for 
creating URIs for the StudentNews project.
#----------------------------------------------------------

viafURI_v2.py will lookup VIAF authorities for named entities (people, organizations, places...).
The result is a tab-delimited file with three or more columns.
Col 1: VIAF ID
Col 2: full URL
Col 3+: prefered terms for that ID

Currently, there is limited UI built in to the application and requires the easygui package.
To install easygui, type: easy_install easygui into your browser
