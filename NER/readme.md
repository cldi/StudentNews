# Named Entity Recognition
This section contains the code and information regarding the way our text files were processed to retrieve named entities.

## Tool
We used the StanfordNER tool, available [on their site](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html "StanfordNER"). The chosen model is the 4 Class (person, location, organization and miscellaneous). 
Note: Java 8 is required (for the version we used).

## Command line code
From the command line, you will want to run one of the lines of code in the CmdLineCodes.txt file.
